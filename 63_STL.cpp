/* STL is very imp for competitive programing
STL => Standard Template Library =>generic classes and functions
why stl-> reuse well tested components
            time saving

//components of STL
1 containers ->stores data
2 algorithms ->sorting
                searching
                use template function
3 iterators -> objects points to an element in a containers
                handled just like pointers
                connects algo containers
                plays an imp role in data manipulation

CONTAINERS
    1 sequence contaoners -> linear fashion 
        1.1 vector
            random access is fast
            insertion and deletion in middle is slow
            insertion at the end is fast

        1.2 list
            random access is slow
            insertion in middle and end is fast than array
        1.3 deque

    2 associative containers -> direct acess ->fast access except random acess ->store data in tree form
        2.2 map/ multimap
        2.3 set/ multiset

    3 derived containers -> realworld modeling ->depends ->data structure
        1 stack
        2 queue
        3 priority queue
